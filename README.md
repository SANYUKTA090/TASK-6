TASK-6 Password Strength Evaluation

1) Task Overview: This task aims to build awareness of password security by creating passwords of varying strengths, testing them using online password strength tools, and documenting the results. It helps in understanding what makes a password strong and how attackers try to break weak ones

2) Objective: Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools

3) Steps Followed:

a. Created 3 passwords of varying complexity (low, medium, high).
b. Tested them on password strength tool:
   - https://passwordmeter.com/
c. Took screenshots of the results for each password.
d. Documented tool feedback, including:
   - Time to crack
   - Weaknesses and strengths
e. Analyzed & compared the passwords.
f. Researched:
   - Brute force attacks
   - Dictionary attacks
   - Importance of password length
   - Passphrases, MFA, password managers
g. Summarized key findings and best practices for strong password creation.

5) Key findings:
- Short passwords are highly vulnerable.
- Using combinations of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols improves strength.
- Longer passwords (12+ characters) are significantly more secure.
- Passphrases are easy to remember and hard to crack.
- Password managers help maintain unique, complex passwords for all accounts.
- MFA adds an additional layer of security and is highly recommended.

6) Key Concepts Learned:
- Brute Force Attack: Tries all combinations of characters until it finds the password
- Dictionary Attack: Uses a list of common passwords or words to guess
- Password Managers: Tools to generate, store, and manage strong passwords securely
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds another layer like OTP or biometric, increasing security
- Passphrases: Long, easy-to-remember phrases that are hard to break (e.g., `Sunlight$OnMy#Window123`)
- Entropy:  A measure of password randomness â€” higher entropy = stronger password
